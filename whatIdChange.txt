If I could change one thing about my favorite language- currently javascript- it would be how it handles null values. 
Every time I have to do anything involving a null value I look up what I'm doing, just to be absolutely sure I'm not screwing 
something up, because some of the weird interactions between null and other types of values can be incredibly obtuse and can potentially 
hazardous. Most of the time- at least from what I've run into in my limited experience- it stems from not knowing what type of value
might be pushed into a variable, many cases of which can be simply fixed by just using typescript.
